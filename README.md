# Cogs111_Participation_Record_Pipeline
This is the pipeline built to process the participation credits for Cogs 111 in WI24

To have the pipeline running, make sure you have all the participation records stored in their own folder (I separated them into different weeks) and rename the file to the date of the lecture (more detail included in the jupyter notebook). The participation record for WI24 (sample output for this pipeline) can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZvP1N-38dD1XISa0--tas1ch_N70zTAr5YRZWtNTow/edit?usp=sharing.
